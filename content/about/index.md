##Story

####Hi there. I'm Rob Majuri.

I'm an English teacher turned software developer.

I have a deep love for learning the technical elements of a craft and then synthesizing that knowlegde to create something new. I've done this in the past while composing music and writing and literature. I ultimately decided to invest my creative energies in software development because the discpline allows me to create products that are useful to others in their daily lives.

_Not to mention that the life of a developer is full of what I love doing most - learning._
