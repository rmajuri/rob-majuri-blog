If, like me, you're a developer who appreciates good design choices, the Material UI React library is probably something you're interested in using, if you haven't used it already.

If you've never used the Material UI library for React, here's how you get up and running.

`npm i @material-ui/core`

Then, in you're component files, you can import whichever MUI components you'd like via tree shaking.

`import { Button } from '@material-ui/core'`

Now you can use those components in your React code.
